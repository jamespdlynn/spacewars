                Space Wars 3014 is a space based MMO (massively multiplayer online game), that's played directly within your browser.
                This is an early alpha build, and as such, expect features to be continually added, removed and tweaked.
                Also I can make no guarantee of the game's stability or even the server being up from day to day.
            </p>

                I am still deciding the direction in which I want to take Space Wars and remain excited by all the possibilities.
                If you have any questions or feedback on the game or the technology behind it, please feel free to contact me:
